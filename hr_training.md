# HR roles and organization

As per what is explained on the [management page](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/management.md#soc-organization), I would recommend to make sure the following roles are being assigned to people:
* SOC analyst;
* SOC analyst lead;
* SOC detection engineer;
* Threat intel analyst;
* Threat intel lead (if several analysts)
* SIEM expert and data scientist;
* Pentester (offensive team);
* Incident handler;
* Incident manager;
* SOC/CSIRT tools admin;
* SecDevOps analyst;
* SOC/CERT/CSIRT deputy manager.
* SOC/CERT/CSIRT manager.

They can be FTE or outsourced, it will depend on your needs and constraints. My recommendations are explained in the RACI template that I propose.
